The matlab or octave code is split on two parts.


1) The first, which translates the INEGI ITRF08 Epoch 2010 geodesic coordinates into the given USER epoch.
 This is performed using the file 
 TraslacionEstacionesINEGI_RGNA_ITRF_2008_Epoca_2010_a_epoca_USUARIO.m
 
 Open in Octave GUI and modfy the following lines
 
ano=2016
dia_del_ano_aprox=135

ano>   stands for year, so if today is year 2019, set 2019
dia_del_ano_aprox>   current day of the year starting in january of the current year. This is approximate.

The coordinates of the known stations are set into the code, but I found an update was made on the equipment, and the positions may have changed as Sept 5, 2016.
An update is required as some stations dissapeared.

This version works with previous stations list.
